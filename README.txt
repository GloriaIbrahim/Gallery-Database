DESCRIPTION
The project is an art gallery database. The scope is to display the artists’ paintings and advertise these paintings by shows that would be supported by sponsors and presented by the featured artists. The target audience is people who have passion and unique taste in art. The reason behind this database is to declare the most sold paintings, people’s favourite artists, the type of art that most people like and the most interested sponsors in this field as well as the income for the art gallery and the profits per year. There will be 9 tables (seven main tables). The ARTIST table will have a one to many relationship with SHOW table as there will be just one artist who is responsible to present the show, on the other hand there will be plenty of shows that the artist would have to present. The SHOW table would have a many to many relationship with SPONSORS table as there would be many sponsors who could support the show and also the one sponsor could support plenty of shows. The ARTIST table would have a one to many relationship with PAINTING table as the artist could make plenty of paintings but the painting would only be made by one artist. The PAINTING table would have many to many relationship with the EXHIBITION table as the one painting could be used in different exhibitions and the one exhibition could have plenty of paintings. The PAINTING table would have a one to many relationship with CLIENT table as the one painting could only be bought by one client but the client could buy many paintings. The CLIENT table would have a one to one relationship with RECEIPT table as the one client would have one receipt and the one receipt would only be for one client. The other two tables are the tables of the many to many relationships.
